This paper describes the variables of tidy dataset. Firstly, describes original data, which were processed to new form. Next, tidy dataset.

## Data
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are (which was used in final data): 

mean(): Mean value

std(): Standard deviation

## Tidy data
Values were processed and reduced to next values:

* subject: Subject id (1 to 30)

* activity: Activity name
  
  Character in: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING STANDING, LAYING

* Next 79 columns represent average of variables for each id and activity. Variables are getting from folder "UCI HAR Dataset". The measurements used are described above. We extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement and calculate average for each id and activity group (grouped by user id and activity).
